This is a modern fork of the `llvm-min-camll` project.

My immediate goals are to explore and document this archived project.

Forking this project made me feel like an archeologist, stumbling upon a
long-dormant relic of the past. I have beginner level knowledge of OCAML
and have not yet taken a compilers class. I have never touched LLVM IR.


ALL OF THE INFORMATION BELOW IS FROM THE ORIGINAL `llvm-min-caml` PROJECT


OVERVIEW:

llvm-min-caml is a compiler for a subset of the OCaml programming
language that targets the LLVM intermediate representation. It builds
directly on the work of Eijiro Sumii, Moe Masuko, Kenichi Asai, who
built the min-caml compiler targeting SPARC, PowerPC, and x86 assembly.
Their project (along with documentation) can be found at

            http://min-caml.sourceforge.net/index-e.html

I added a new backend targeting LLVM. Since I have no intention of
mantaining the other backends, I have removed them (along with all other
supporting files) from my distribution.

The current status is full support of all the features of the original
min-caml compiler, as can be found in the above website. In particular,
we perform full tail-call optimization.

OTHER LLVM PORTS:

There are at least two other LLVM ports of min-caml that can be found
through Google, but both fail to correctly perform tail-call optimization
in all cases.

* https://github.com/mzp/min-caml

* https://github.com/kmacy/llmincaml

The second one (llmincaml) failed to produce any LLVM output in fact when
I compiled it. But inspection of the source shows that it does not perform
tail call optimization in the case of an 'If' in tail position.

PREREQUISITES:

* OCaml

I have 4.00.0 in my machine, but it should work with
previous versions as well. I will update this README once
I find out about this. The OCaml distribution can be
downloaded from

      http://caml.inria.fr

* LLVM with Ocaml bindings

I used LLVM version 3.1 but, again, it should work with
earlier versions as well. I will update this README once
I find out about this.

In any case, installing this should be as easy as running

      opam install llvm

BUILDING:

If both the prerequisites are installed and configured
correclty, then follow the steps to build the llvm-min-caml
compiler.

1- Get the source from GitHub

      git clone https://github.com/nojb/llvm-min-caml.git

2- A directory named 'llvm-min-caml' will have been created.
   Move into it.

      cd llvm-min-caml

3- Build the sources.

      ocamlbuild main.native

4- Test the compiler.

I will add a proper test suite in the future, but for now
you can do the following to compile the test test/gcd.ml.

      ./main.native -iter 0 test/gcd

(the flag -iter 0 disables all optimizations so that the output
is easier to read.) This will create a file test/gcd.bc containing
the LLVM bitcode. To actually see it, you can use the llvm-dis utility
from the LLVM distribution.

      llvm-dis < test/gcd.bc

CHANGELOG FOR PRE-LLVM VERSIONS:

[Update on July 24, 2012]

- 32-bit x86 (with SSE2, that is, Pentium IV or later) is now
  supported (on Linux and Cygwin); execute ./to_x86 before make.

[Updates on September 17, 2008]

- PowerPC is now supported (in addition to SPARC), thanks to
  Ms. Masuko and Prof. Asai in Ochanomizu University.  You _must_
  execute either ./to_ppc or ./to_sparc _before_ make.

- The register allocator now uses a simpler algorithm.  It omits the
  backtracking (ToSpill and NoSpill) in previous versions.
